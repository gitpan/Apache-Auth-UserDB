apache-auth-userdb-perl (0.120) unstable; urgency=low

  Debian:
  * Renamed source package to apache-auth-userdb-perl
    (was: libapache-auth-userdb-perl).
  * Standards-Version: 3.7.2 (was: 3.6.1)
  * Raised build dependency and compatibility level on debhelper to version 5
    (was: 4.0.2).
  * Tweaked other build dependencies.
  * Depends: perl (>= 5.6) (was: ${perl:Depends})
  * Slightly tweaked package description.
  * debian/copyright: Refer to GPL-2 rather than GPL license file.
  * debian/rules: Minor tweaks.

  Apache::Auth::UserDB:
  + Added support for overwriting user DB files in-place as opposed to writing
    a new file and renaming it over the old one.  This way file ownership and
    permissions can be preserved.
  * Turned global constants into object methods, thereby improving mod_perl
    compatibility.
  * Use version module.
